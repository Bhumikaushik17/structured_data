🛠️ Project Title: Unstructured to Structured Data Converter in Python
📄 Description:
This Python project is designed to convert unstructured data—such as plain text, logs, or loosely formatted files—into structured data like CSV, JSON, or database tables. Structured data is organized and formatted in a way that makes it easier to search, analyze, and process using data analysis tools or software.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how Python can be used for data cleaning, pattern extraction, and transformation, which are critical tasks in data preprocessing, data analysis, and machine learning workflows.
